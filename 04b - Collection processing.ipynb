    "# Processing long files with streams\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes a collection of long recordings for quality-related audio features. The features that it computes are basically the same as those in the previous notebook (04 - Measuring Audio Quality), but the features are summarized by their statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we analyze here consists of many long recordings (about 1 hour each), so loading an entire recording into memory and doing feature extraction would take more memory than we typically have on a laptop.  Instead, librosa allows us to work in *blocks* of audio at a time using the `librosa.stream()` function.  We compute the spectral roll-off and contrast features for each block, and then summarize all of the block-wise features to get a description of the entire recording. *Please note that the audio files we are using here are not available as part of this notebook.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It saves the results in a CSV file / pandas data frame that can be loaded back later for analysis.  This CSV file will power the visualization code used in the next notebook.\n",

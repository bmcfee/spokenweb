    "# Measuring audio quality\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides some simple computational methods to roughly estimate the quality or intelligibility of an audio recording.\n",
    "Perceptual quality is a difficult concept to pin down precisely, but we'll be using two methods to estimate different aspects of audio\n",
    "that influence quality: *spectral roll-off* and *spectral contrast*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries: spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by assuming that an audio signal `y` has already been transformed into a magnitude spectrogram `S`, so that the matrix entry `S[f, t]` measures the amount of energy at frequency index `f` and time index `t`.  Each column `S[:, t]` (also known as a *frame*) corresponds to the discrete Fourier transform magnitudes of a short excerpt centered around time index `t`.  Both of the methods we'll use below work independently on each frame, and the results can be aggregated to summarize the entire clip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral roll-off\n",
    "\n",
    "The **spectral roll-off** is defined as the frequency `f` at which some given percentage of the total energy is contained at frequencies `f' <= f`.  Higher roll-off values correspond to higher frequency content, which may sound *crisper* or *brighter*, while lower roll-off values mean there is little or no content at high frequencies, leading to a muffled sound.  Typical percentage values for roll-off are 85% or 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, the *sampling rate* of the audio in question (typically 44100 Hz for CD-quality audio) dictates an upper bound on frequency content: there can never be energy for a frequency larger than half the sampling rate (e.g., 22050 Hz).  However, it is common for audio to be resampled or converted to different formats, so the true cut-off frequency might be much lower than half the sampling rate in general.  Spectral roll-off gives a robust way to measure this property independent of the file's sampling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio can also sound muffled if there is not a sufficient difference in *loudness* between the foreground (e.g., voice) and background (e.g., noise).  The **spectral contrast** feature tries to measure this in a way that is agnostic to the sources of sound.  It proceeds by first breaking the frequency range into octaves.  For each octave (say, 100 Hz to 200 Hz), the distribution of energies is measured, and the contrast is estimated by comparing the highest energy to the lowest energy observed within the octave (in decibels).  (More precisely, percentile estimates are used, but you may think of it as maximum and minimum to get the intuition.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, if you have a pure tone with no background noise, then it will have a high contrast.  If you have broad-band noise (e.g., wind or running water), then there will be little distinction between the highest and lowest energy values, and it will have low-contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "As contrast is computed independently per-octave, it returns a list of measurements for each time index.  For our purposes, we will restrict attention to a set of octaves covering the typical range of human voice (about 85 Hz to 3000 Hz)."
